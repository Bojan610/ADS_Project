WCF Console App

In this project, it is demonstrated a client-server communication between console apps, implemented through Windows Communication Foundation (WCF). In the project, authentification and authorization functionalities 
 are implemented, as well as dependency injection principles, using interfaces. The project also contains one more specific kind of client: the Replicator. The replicator replicates data from one server to another one in a certain period, thus simulating the failure resistance of the server.
