WCF Console App

This project demonstrates client–server communication between console applications implemented using Windows Communication Foundation (WCF).

It includes authentication and authorization mechanisms, as well as dependency injection through the use of interfaces.

In addition to the standard client, the project features a specialized client called the Replicator. The Replicator periodically replicates data from one server to another, simulating server fault tolerance and ensuring system resilience in case of failure.
